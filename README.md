# python-requests-patch (In Progress)

# Works in python 2.7.x

A monkey-patch for python requests module to make the requests sent by it look more like the requests sent by a browser.

Currently only works with Firefox and Opera.

Required modules:-

`requests`

`user_agents`

(For noobs) To use it import everything from the reqpatch.py to your python code:-

`from reqpatch import *`
